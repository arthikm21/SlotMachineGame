Slot Machine Game
Hey there! Welcome to my simple yet exciting slot machine game implemented in Python.

How to Play
Deposit Money:

Input the number of lines you're feeling lucky on (choose from 1 to 3).
Tell me the amount you want to bet on each line.
Spin the Reels:

Press Enter, and let the magic unfold as the reels spin.
Watch out for the symbols; they're randomly generated for each line.
Check Winnings:

Did you win? I'll make sure to shout out your winnings and the lucky lines.
I'll update your account balance accordingly.
Quit the Game:

If you've had your fill of excitement, just press 'q' when prompted to spin.
Symbol Configuration
I've set up the slot machine with these symbols and their counts and values:

python
Copy code
symbol_count = {
    "A": 2,
    "B": 4,
    "C": 6,
    "D": 8
}

symbol_value = {
    "A": 5,
    "B": 4,
    "C": 3,
    "D": 2
}
Feel free to tweak the counts and values to change up the game dynamics.
